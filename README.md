### A Wifi connected doorbell to notify when someone is at the door. 
#
## Introduction

This is the Wifi Doorbell project. A Wireless Doorbell able to run on battery or from some external 5v power supply. It shall be rugged and able to handle being outside for a long time, in all weathers and temperatures. 

The idea of a wireless doorbell comes from the problem of not seeing or hearing when someone is at the door. This is not acceptable and must be fixed! Everyone that whant to come in and become a member must be welcomed. Or it may be it's YOU that have forgotten your access card, how knows?
